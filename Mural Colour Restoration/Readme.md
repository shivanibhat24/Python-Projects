Use the left sidebar sliders to customize:

- **Contrast Enhancement**: Increase from 0.5 to 3.0 for more dramatic contrast
- **Brightness Adjustment**: Range from -50 to +50 to correct lighting
- **Saturation Enhancement**: Boost from 0.5 to 2.0 for color vibrancy
- **Blur Reduction Kernel**: Adjust from 3 to 15 for noise reduction
- **Denoise Strength**: Control denoising intensity from 0 to 20

**Step 3: View Results**

The processed image appears on the right panel with metrics showing image dimensions and processing stats.

**Step 4: Analyze Details**

Navigate through tabs for detailed analysis:

- **Color Fidelity**: View color quality metrics and trends
- **Histogram Analysis**: Examine RGB channel distributions
- **Edge Detection**: Compare edge details
- **Comparison**: View side-by-side comparison with difference map

**Step 5: Download Results**

Download the restored image as PNG, download a comparison visualization, or export high-quality outputs at 150 DPI.

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Faded Mural**

- Increase Saturation Enhancement to 1.5-2.0
- Boost Contrast Enhancement to 2.0-2.5
- Adjust Brightness as needed
- Result: Vibrant colors restored to original appearance

**Scenario 2: Noisy/Degraded Mural**

- Increase Denoise Strength to 15-20
- Adjust Blur Reduction Kernel to 7-11
- Moderate Contrast Enhancement (1.5-1.8)
- Result: Clean image with preserved details

**Scenario 3: Poorly Lit Mural**

- Adjust Brightness Adjustment (+10 to +30)
- Increase Contrast Enhancement (1.8-2.2)
- Fine-tune Denoise Strength (8-12)
- Result: Well-lit image with visible details

## üîß Technical Details

### Image Processing Pipeline

The application implements a sophisticated multi-stage processing pipeline:

**Stage 1: Denoising**

Non-Local Means (NLM) filter removes noise while preserving edges

**Stage 2: Brightness Adjustment**

Linear brightness correction applied uniformly across the image

**Stage 3: Contrast Enhancement**

Adaptive histogram equalization for local contrast improvement

**Stage 4: Saturation Enhancement**

HSV color space conversion and saturation scaling to restore color vibrancy

**Stage 5: Bilateral Filtering**

Edge-preserving smoothing with 9x9 kernel and sigma=75

**Stage 6: Sharpening**

Unsharp masking kernel for enhanced detail definition

### Mathematical Foundations

- **Color Space Conversion**: RGB ‚Üî BGR ‚Üî HSV transformations
- **Histogram Equalization**: Adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
- **Edge-Aware Processing**: Bilateral filtering with Gaussian kernels
- **Noise Reduction**: Non-local similarity-based denoising
- **Contrast Metrics**: Standard deviation and histogram analysis

### Color Fidelity Calculation

Color fidelity is calculated as:

```
Fidelity = clip(std_dev(grayscale) / 2.56, 40, 100)
```

This metric ranges from 40-100, where higher values indicate better color preservation and distinction.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Application won't start

**Solution**: Verify all dependencies are installed

```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlit opencv-python pillow numpy scikit-image matplotlib
```

### Issue: Slow processing on large images

**Solution**:

- Use images no larger than 4000x4000 pixels
- Reduce denoise strength (below 15)
- Lower contrast enhancement slightly
- Consider GPU acceleration with CUDA

### Issue: Downloaded image quality is poor

**Solution**:

- Check original image resolution (minimum 800x600 recommended)
- Adjust DPI in download (modify `dpi=150` in code to `dpi=300`)
- Verify color space settings

### Issue: Color fidelity not improving

**Solution**:

- Original image might have severe color loss
- Try increasing saturation enhancement progressively
- Adjust brightness and contrast together
- Experiment with denoise strength

### Issue: Memory error on very large images

**Solution**:

- Resize image before uploading (max 5000x5000)
- Close other applications
- Reduce processing intensity parameters
- Use system with more RAM
